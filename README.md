## Purpose

`jklmbot` is a simple script to let your computer play "BombParty" on the website [*jklm.fun*](https://jklm.fun)

> **Warning**  
> The code for this script hasn't been updated for a long time and might not work as well as back when the code was written! Please [contribute](#contributing) and fix stuff if you spot any bug üôá.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You will need Python 3 to use this module

```bash
Minimum required versions: 3.8
```

Although the code itself is made compatible with Python >=3.6, the dependencies require at least Python 3.8.

Always check if your Python version works with `jklmbot` before using it in production.

## Installing

### From Git

```bash
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/Animenosekai/jklmbot.git
```

> This will install the latest development version from the git repository

You can check if you successfully installed it by printing out its version:

```bash
$ jklmbot --version
1.0
```

## Usage

Go create a "BombParty" room on [*jklm.fun*](https://jklm.fun) and run the script using:

```bash
jklmbot --room="<YOUR_ROOM_ID>"
```

But there are lots of stuff to customize so head over to your terminal and enter:

```bash
üßÉ‚ùØ jklmbot --help
usage: jklmbot [-h] [--version] --room ROOM [--username USERNAME] [--picture PICTURE] [--browser BROWSER] [--headless] [--delay DELAY] [--key KEY] [--check CHECK]

Win all of your JKLM.fun games!
